# DEPRECATION NOTICE

This library is no longer maintained. The mobile app platform is now leaning towards a standard where regular URLs (more or less) redirect to an app. This involves hosting separate files, something this library cannot do for you.

- Android [App Links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/index.html)
- iOS [Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppSearch/UniversalLinks.html)

I discourage using this library and encourage using this new standard instead.

# deep-link.js

**deep-link.js** is designed to add deep links to the web in an easy and stable way.

Mobile deep links are links that refer to apps instead of another web page. Opening things in apps can vastly improve a user’s experience.

## Install

	bower install deep-link.js
